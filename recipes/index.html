    <h1>Shawarma</h1>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2.5 lbs of thinly cut skinless boneless chicken breast</li>
      <li>½ cup of lemon juice</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons of tomato sauce</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons of plain (Greek) yogurt</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons of white vinegar</li>
      <li>1 head of garlic, crushed</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons of olive oil</li>
      <li>1 to 1.5 teaspoons of salt (or to taste)</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon of ground oregano (or thyme)</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon of paprika</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon of ginger powder (optional)</li>
      <li>A pinch of nutmeg powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Rinse the boneless chicken breasts with fresh cold water then cut
        horizontally into thinner cuts of about ½ inch (each breast could
        possibly be split into 2 slices depending on thickness).
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix all ingredients in a blender, add to a bowl and mix well with the
        chicken, cover and let marinate in the fridge overnight.
      </li>
      <li>
        When ready, grill the marinated chicken using a panini/George Forman
        grill for about 15 minutes on medium heat. You can also cook the chicken
        on a BBQ grill if so you wish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once cooked, shred the chicken thinly as in the photo and it's now ready
        to be wrapped into a Shawarma Sandwich. Spread the chicken shreds along
        the diameter of a pita bread, spread a bit of Lebanese Garlic paste, add
        some salty cucumber pickles, some French fries, and some grilled
        tomatoes, roll and enjoy.
      </li>
    </ol>
